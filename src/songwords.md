# Song Words

The following applies to text output from the AV computer including song words, liturgy, and scripture.

There are two outputs from the AV desk that enable the ATEM to overlay song words on the live stream:

1. AV output: from EasyWorship running on the AV PC.
There is a HDMI output of a graphics card in the AV PC which passes, (presumably) via a HDMI to SDI converter, to the live streaming rack.
The content of this appears on the live streaming multiview monitor as "AV PC" at the bottom left.
When a song is displayed on EasyWorship, the words appear here as white on a black background.

2. Alpha channel: from EasyWorship running on the AV PC.
There is a DiplayPort output of a graphics card in the AV PC which passes, (presumably) via a DisplayPort to HDMI converter, to the live streaming rack.
The contents of this appears on the live streaming multiview monitor as "HDMI Input" at the bottom right.
When a song is displayed on EasyWorship, the words appear "thickened" and in white on a black background. The thickening is due to a black outline on the song words.
