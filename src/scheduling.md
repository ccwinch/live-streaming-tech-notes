## Scheduling Services

Each service needs a YouTube stream and a service on the Church Online Platform which refers to the YouTube stream. Essentially, you can create a YouTube stream from a past stream. For Church Online, you need to go to the admin view, click "services" on the left, set the filter to include the required date, and then add (or edit) content to the relevant service. View an old service and copy across all relevant timings, settings, and audience and host help information.

This [8 minute video](https://youtu.be/eBEigfqjTKM) shows how to schedule a new YouTube stream.

You may need to do this in an emergency if you encounter a situation where the stream you want to "go live" has already been used. The "go live" icon is greyed out and you need to schedule a new stream and set that into the Church Online service. It's relatively easy to do this from the streaming PC if you hit this problem.

We've also started adding a custom thumbnail to each stream. There's one for "all in" services and then five 11am and five 7pm thumbnails - one for each week of the month.
