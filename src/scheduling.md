## Scheduling Services

Each service needs a YouTube stream. Essentially, you can create a YouTube stream from a past stream.

This [8 minute video](https://youtu.be/eBEigfqjTKM) shows how to schedule a new YouTube stream except that now we are using YouTube as the platform for the online congregation, you should make the stream public and enable "chat" and "chat replay" and there is now no longer a need for a "catch up" playlist, so new YouTube streams do not need to belong to a playlist.

You may need to schedule a stream in an emergency if you encounter a situation where the stream you want to "go live" has already been used. The "go live" icon is greyed out and you need to schedule a new stream. It's relatively easy to do this from the streaming PC if you hit this problem.

We've also started adding a custom thumbnail to each stream. There's one for "all in" services and then five 11am and five 7pm thumbnails - one for each week of the month.
