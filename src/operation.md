## During the Service

Some tips:
* Use the remote camera controller to operate cameras.
  - Choose a preset or manually zoom/pan each camera unless it is "live" (being displayed on the "program").
* Use the switcher to choose which camera to stream
  - Set the preview to the next camera, then use the "cut" button to make it live (or the "auto" button to fade, e.g. during sermons).
* To overlay words from the AV team, press the switcher "song words" button.
* To display one of the slides (back soon, end of service), select that slide under media player 1 in the ATEM software and then select "MP 1" (using either Shift key).
* Most of the time, cut between the preview and programme (using the "cut" button on the switcher). During "unstructured" periods of a service (e.g. when the service leader suggests a period of reflection while the band plays quietly), cross-fading (using the "auto" button on the switcher) can work ok.
* Avoid cutting between cameras showing people from the same angle and with the same size. Better to cut via another shot which is closer, further out, or from another angle.
* Try to avoid "flipping" the direction in which people are facing, e.g. by cutting between two cameras pointing in opposite directions.
* During speech, try to cut at the beginning of a phrase. During worship, try to cut at the end of a verse or at least at the end of a line of a song.
* Keep one camera on a wide "safety shot" so you can cut to this if necessary, e.g. if the preacher starts moving around suddenly during a sermon.
* Try to anticipate what's going to happen next. For example, if the service leader is about to hand over to the band, cut via a shot which includes them both.
* If you think someone is going to take a little while to get set up, e.g. someone leading prayers may need to pick up a microphone or remove a face mask, then cutting just before this happens makes the viewers more forgiving of the delay. The cut effectively gives 5-10 seconds of interest.
* When videos are played, don't forget to turn the Christ Church logo off. Also, start with a wide shot of the church which includes the screens and cross-fade to the video as it starts. At the end of the video, either cross-fade back to the wide shot or cut if you think it seems more appropriate.
* During worship, sometimes a close shot of one or two people in the band or of an instrumentalist's hands can add variety and interest. This works particularly well if you are familiar with the song and know when instrumental sections are coming up.
* If you have two cameras next to each other, you can cut back and forth between a head and shoulders shot of a speaker and a shot of their full height. Since the angle doesn't change, this is less distracting than cutting from side to side.
* Try to turn off the song words as soon as they are no longer needed. It may be worth having a word with the person on the AV desk before the service starts and asking them to delay a couple of seconds after a song finishes before putting the Christ Church Winchester logo back on the screen as this has a bad appearance on the live stream.
