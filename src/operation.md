## Set Up and Set Down

See the [official site](https://www.ccwinch.org.uk/streaming) for set up and set down instructions.

## During the Service

Some tips:
* Use the remote camera controller to operate cameras.
  - Choose a preset or manually zoom/pan each camera unless it is "live" (being displayed on the "program").
* Use the switcher to choose which camera to stream
  - Set the preview to the next camera, then use the "cut" button to make it live (or the "auto" button to fade, e.g. during sermons).
* To overlay words from the AV team, press the switcher "song words" button.
* To display one of the slides (back soon, end of service), select that slide under media player 1 in the ATEM software and then select "MP 1" (using either Shift key).
