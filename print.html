<h2 id="set-up-and-set-down"><a class="header" href="#set-up-and-set-down">Set Up and Set Down</a></h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.ccwinch.org.uk/streaming">official site</a> for set up and set down instructions.</p>
<h2 id="during-the-service"><a class="header" href="#during-the-service">During the Service</a></h2>
<p>Usually one person operates the switcher and another operates the camera controller.</p>
<h3 id="video-switching"><a class="header" href="#video-switching">Video switching</a></h3>
<p>Use the ATEM video switcher to choose which camera to stream. Set the preview to the next camera, then use the &quot;cut&quot; button to make it live (or the &quot;auto&quot; button to cross-fade, but use this sparingly - see below).</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>To overlay words from the AV team, press the switcher &quot;song words&quot; button.</li>
<li>Most of the time, cut between the preview and programme (using the &quot;cut&quot; button on the switcher). During &quot;unstructured&quot; periods of a service (e.g. when the service leader suggests a period of reflection while the band plays quietly), cross-fading (using the &quot;auto&quot; button on the switcher) can work ok. Here's an <a href="https://youtu.be/9lR070t_nFA?list=PLz-8ZbAJhahjvkPtduhnB4TzhVcj5ZtfC&amp;t=4022">example</a> of an initial cut followed by cross-fading.</li>
<li>During worship, cut relatively often when the tempo of the music is fast and less often when the tempo is slow.</li>
<li>Avoid cutting between cameras showing people from the same angle and with the same size. Better to cut via another shot which is closer, further out, or from another angle.</li>
<li>Try to avoid &quot;flipping&quot; the direction in which people are facing, e.g. by cutting between two cameras pointing in opposing directions.</li>
<li>During speech, try to cut at the beginning of a phrase. During worship, try to cut at the end of a verse, or at least at the end of a line of a song.</li>
<li>Try to anticipate what's going to happen next. For example, if the service leader is about to hand over to the band, cut via a shot which includes them both.</li>
<li>If you think someone is going to take a little while to get set up, e.g. someone leading prayers may need to pick up a microphone or remove a face mask, then cutting just before this happens makes the viewers more forgiving of the delay. The cut effectively gives 5-10 seconds of extra attention. Here's an <a href="https://youtu.be/9lR070t_nFA?list=PLz-8ZbAJhahjvkPtduhnB4TzhVcj5ZtfC&amp;t=2143">example</a>.</li>
<li>When videos are played, don't forget to turn the Christ Church logo off. Also, start with a wide shot of the church which includes the screens and cross-fade to the video as it starts (here's an <a href="https://youtu.be/9lR070t_nFA?list=PLz-8ZbAJhahjvkPtduhnB4TzhVcj5ZtfC&amp;t=1556">example</a>). At the end of the video, either cross-fade back to the wide shot or cut if you think it seems more appropriate.</li>
<li>If you have two cameras next to each other, you can cut back and forth between a head and shoulders shot of a speaker and a shot of their full height. Since the angle doesn't change, this is less distracting than cutting from side to side. Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lR070t_nFA&amp;list=PLz-8ZbAJhahjvkPtduhnB4TzhVcj5ZtfC&amp;t=1916s">example</a>.</li>
<li>Try to turn off the song words as soon as they are no longer needed. It may be worth having a word with the person on the AV desk before the service starts and asking them to delay a couple of seconds after a song finishes before putting the Christ Church Winchester logo back on the screen as this has a bad appearance on the live stream.</li>
<li>To display one of the slides, such as the words for use while people are taking communion, select the corresponding media player using either Shift key and, for example, &quot;MP 1&quot;.</li>
<li>If you need to mute the sound, use the ATEM switcher software on the live streaming PC. In the audio tab there is a master volume control which can be muted by clicking &quot;on&quot; (and clicking it again to unmute).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="camera-control"><a class="header" href="#camera-control">Camera Control</a></h3>
<p>Use the remote camera controller to operate the remote PTZ cameras.</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a preset or manually zoom/pan each camera unless it is &quot;live&quot; (being displayed on the &quot;programme&quot; pane of the multiview monitor).</li>
<li>Keep one camera on a wide &quot;safety shot&quot; so the switcher operator can cut to this if necessary, e.g. if the preacher starts moving around suddenly during a sermon. Camera 4 is often a good fallback for a wide shot as its quality isn't the best. Here's an <a href="https://youtu.be/9lR070t_nFA?list=PLz-8ZbAJhahjvkPtduhnB4TzhVcj5ZtfC&amp;t=2602">example</a> where the preacher caught us off-guard, but we recovered using camera 4.</li>
<li>After the countdown, start with a wide <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-an-establishing-shot-definition-examples/">&quot;establishing shot&quot;</a> to set the scene (as well as the tone/mood). Here's an <a href="https://youtu.be/9lR070t_nFA?list=PLz-8ZbAJhahjvkPtduhnB4TzhVcj5ZtfC&amp;t=280">example</a>.</li>
<li>During worship, sometimes a close shot of one or two people in the band (here's an <a href="https://youtu.be/9lR070t_nFA?list=PLz-8ZbAJhahjvkPtduhnB4TzhVcj5ZtfC&amp;t=4702">example</a>) or of an instrumentalist's hands (an <a href="https://youtu.be/9lR070t_nFA?list=PLz-8ZbAJhahjvkPtduhnB4TzhVcj5ZtfC&amp;t=4118">example</a>) can add variety and interest. This works particularly well if the switcher operator is familiar with the song and can anticipate when instrumental sections are coming up.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="problem-solving"><a class="header" href="#problem-solving">Problem Solving</a></h2>
<p>In general, try to narrow down and eventually isolate the cause of the problem. If there is a problem with one or two cameras and you can't fix it before the service starts, you may be able to make do with the remaining cameras.</p>
<p>Remember the all-important line from &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; TV series: &quot;Have you tried turning it off and back on again?&quot;.</p>
<p>If you get stuck, try asking on the &quot;CCW Stream Team&quot; WhatsApp group or see if there's someone around in church who can help.</p>
<p>The following problems are organised by problem symptoms, each with possible explanations and fixes. If you find a problem not listed here, please tell others about it so it can be added.</p>
<h2 id="atem-switcher-is-powered-off-no-lights"><a class="header" href="#atem-switcher-is-powered-off-no-lights">ATEM switcher is powered off (&quot;no lights&quot;)</a></h2>
<p>This is often caused by the power cable coming loose when the switcher is slid out of the rack for operation. Reach over the back of the switcher and plug the power cable back in on the right hand side.</p>
<h2 id="the-multiview-monitor-is-black"><a class="header" href="#the-multiview-monitor-is-black">The multiview monitor is black</a></h2>
<p>Check the monitor power and display cables are securely plugged in at both ends.</p>
<h2 id="the-camera-controller-is-powered-off-no-lights"><a class="header" href="#the-camera-controller-is-powered-off-no-lights">The camera controller is powered off (&quot;no lights&quot;)</a></h2>
<p>Check the power cable hasn't come loose.</p>
<h2 id="the-streaming-pc-display-is-black"><a class="header" href="#the-streaming-pc-display-is-black">The streaming PC display is black</a></h2>
<p>Check the display power and display cables are securely plugged in at both ends.</p>
<h2 id="the-encoder-is-powered-off-no-lights"><a class="header" href="#the-encoder-is-powered-off-no-lights">The encoder is powered off (&quot;no lights&quot;)</a></h2>
<p>The encoder (the topmost unit in the streaming rack) is powered by a lead inside the back of the streaming rack which may become disconnected. Ensure the mains lead is plugged in at both ends.</p>
<h2 id="the-video-of-a-camera-does-not-appear-on-the-multiview-display"><a class="header" href="#the-video-of-a-camera-does-not-appear-on-the-multiview-display">The video of a camera does not appear on the multiview display</a></h2>
<p>This may be because the camera has not been powered on. Use the camera controller to power all the cameras off and back on.</p>
<p>To see if the camera is powered on, double click the relevant camera icon on the streaming PC desktop. If you see a picture from the camera, it is powered on and the problem may be that the SDI (video) cable is not properly connected to the camera (or to the back of the rack or to the back of the ATEM switcher). Disconnect and reconnect each plug in turn to ensure it is properly connected.</p>
<h2 id="a-camera-cannot-be-controlled-by-the-camera-controller"><a class="header" href="#a-camera-cannot-be-controlled-by-the-camera-controller">A camera cannot be controlled by the camera controller</a></h2>
<p>This may be because the power-over-ethernet (PoE) cable has been plugged into the wrong socket on the affected camera. Make sure the cable is plugged into the left-hand socket. When re-plugging PoE cables, it is best to power all the cameras down first and power them back up afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="the-camera-controller-fails-to-operate-the-cameras"><a class="header" href="#the-camera-controller-fails-to-operate-the-cameras">The camera controller fails to operate the cameras</a></h2>
<p>The camera controller may still be in menu mode, in which case the &quot;menu&quot; button will be lit. Press the menu button to exit menu mode.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the controller may be operating a group of cameras other than group 1. You need to select group 1, thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press &quot;menu&quot; and then &quot;8&quot;</li>
<li>Select &quot;group&quot; by turning then pressing the F1 dial</li>
<li>Select &quot;group select&quot; by turning then pressing the F2 dial</li>
<li>(I presume) Press &quot;1&quot; to select group 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, it has been known for the camera controller to reset itself to factory defaults.
Try power-cycling the camera controller to see if this fixes the problem. If not, you may need to go to the setup menu and re-enter the IP address of each of the cameras: 192.168.0.181-184 (for cameras 1-4). The cameras also need to be set to &quot;network&quot; connection rather than &quot;serial&quot; (<em>find out how to do this</em>). When entering an IP address, press F2 to select each &quot;dotted decimal&quot; number of the IP address in turn and turn F2 to change the current number. Refer to &quot;Changing the camera numbers&quot; on page 34 of the <em>basic</em> manual for the camera controller (available under <a href="../hardware.html">Hardware</a>) for how to set camera IP addresses.</p>
<h2 id="the-encoder-stream-button-flashes-red"><a class="header" href="#the-encoder-stream-button-flashes-red">The encoder stream button flashes red</a></h2>
<p>This may be due to the encoder looking at the wrong input. Open up the encoder software on the streaming PC (there's a shortcut on the desktop, with a note of the admin password on the shortcut), select the &quot;source&quot; tab, and ensure that
the SDI source is selected (rather than HDMI).</p>
<p>When the encoder is streaming normally, the stream button should be lit red continuously.</p>
<h2 id="the-go-live-icon-is-greyed-out-on-youtube"><a class="header" href="#the-go-live-icon-is-greyed-out-on-youtube">The &quot;go live&quot; icon is greyed out on YouTube</a></h2>
<p>This may be due to the stream in question having already been used, even if only briefly. You
need to create a fresh stream. See <a href="./scheduling.html">Scheduling services</a> for instructions.</p>
<h2 id="the-live-stream-does-not-appear-in-the-preview-on-youtube"><a class="header" href="#the-live-stream-does-not-appear-in-the-preview-on-youtube">The live stream does not appear in the preview on YouTube</a></h2>
<p>This may be because the video encoder in the rack is not yet in streaming mode (the &quot;streaming&quot; button needs to be lit in red). Press the streaming button on the video encoder to start streaming. Note: this isn't usually necessary, so be patient while YouTube connects to the stream as this can take up to 20-30 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="the-live-stream-does-not-appear-on-online-church-even-though-it-is-visible-on-youtube"><a class="header" href="#the-live-stream-does-not-appear-on-online-church-even-though-it-is-visible-on-youtube">The live stream does not appear on Online Church even though it is visible on YouTube</a></h2>
<p>This may be because the current service on Online Church has the wrong link to YouTube. Use the admin area of the Online Church web site, click on &quot;services&quot; on the left hand side, then edit the content of the current service to check the YouTube link. On the YouTube window, click &quot;preview&quot; to see the YouTube link for the stream. If the link is wrong on Online Church, copy the correct link in place and click &quot;save&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-is-not-accessible-from-the-live-streaming-pc"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-is-not-accessible-from-the-live-streaming-pc">The internet is not accessible from the live streaming PC</a></h2>
<p>Ensure the AV desk PC is switched on (it doesn't need to be logged in). Also ensure that the
network router mains switch is turned on - this is next to the AV desk mains switch (on the wall, low down, at the right hand side of the sound desk).</p>
<p>Alternatively, the antivirus/firewall software on the streaming PC may be out of date. Temporarily disable the antivirus/firewall from the network settings to work around this.</p>
<h2 id="poor-sound-quality-on-the-live-stream"><a class="header" href="#poor-sound-quality-on-the-live-stream">Poor sound quality on the live stream</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes the host or a member of the online congregation will point out that the sound is
poor or that there is a specific problem with the sound. Check the sound level on the &quot;live&quot; panel of the multiview monitor. If it seems too low, check with the sound desk operator that the sound desk is correctly set up. If it's still too low, you can boost the volume by using
the ATEM switcher software on the live streaming PC. In the audio tab there is a master volume slider and a xlr slider which can be increased.</p>
<h2 id="incorrect-title-andor-bible-reference-showing-on-online-church"><a class="header" href="#incorrect-title-andor-bible-reference-showing-on-online-church">Incorrect title and/or bible reference showing on Online Church</a></h2>
<p>Edit the current service on Church Online (see <a href="./scheduling.html">Scheduling Services</a>) to correct the mistake. The bible reference is probably on the service notes which are sent out ahead of time and which are usually made available in printed form on the live streaming desk.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="scheduling-services"><a class="header" href="#scheduling-services">Scheduling services</a></h2>
<p>Each service needs a YouTube stream and a service on the Church Online Platform which refers to the YouTube stream. Essentially, you can create a YouTube stream from a past stream. For Church Online, you need to go to the admin view, click &quot;services&quot; on the left, set the filter to include the required date, and then add (or edit) content to the relevant service. View an old service and copy across all relevant timings, settings, and audience and host help information.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://youtu.be/eBEigfqjTKM">8 minute video</a> shows how to schedule a new YouTube stream.</p>
<p>You may need to do this in an emergency if you encounter a situation where the stream you want to &quot;go live&quot; has already been used. The &quot;go live&quot; icon is greyed out and you need to schedule a new stream and set that into the Church Online service. It's relatively easy to do this from the streaming PC if you hit this problem.</p>
<p>We've also started adding a custom thumbnail to each stream. There's one for &quot;all in&quot; services and then five 11am and five 7pm thumbnails - one for each week of the month. Download and unzip <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HA9V86M_gZlESUvfZL8t9qqHNkMnRPLu/view?usp=sharing">this zipfile</a> for the thumbnails.</p>
